Sure! Here's a **sample input file** for your Word Count MapReduce program:

---

### 📄 **Sample Input File: `input.txt`**

```txt
hadoop is an open source framework
hadoop is used for big data processing
mapreduce is a part of hadoop
```

---

### 🔍 Expected Output (word counts):

When your program runs on the above file, the **output** should be something like:

```txt
a       2
an      1
big     1
data    1
for     1
framework       1
hadoop  3
is      3
mapreduce       1
of      1
open    1
part    1
processing      1
source  1
used    1
```

---

### 📁 How to Use the Sample File

1. Save the above input as a file named `input.txt`.
2. Put it into your HDFS directory:
   ```bash
   hdfs dfs -mkdir /wordcount_input
   hdfs dfs -put input.txt /wordcount_input/
   ```
3. Then run your MapReduce job with:
   ```bash
   hadoop jar WordCount.jar WordCount /wordcount_input /wordcount_output
   ```
4. View the result:
   ```bash
   hdfs dfs -cat /wordcount_output/part-r-00000
   ```

Would you like me to generate the file and package it for download?
